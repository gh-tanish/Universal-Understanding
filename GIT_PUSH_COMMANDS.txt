Instructions: create the remote repo on GitHub and push from your machine.

Option A — create remote via GitHub web UI:
1. On GitHub, create a new repository named `universal-understanding-v4` (Public).
2. Do NOT initialize with a README (we already have one locally) to avoid merge conflicts.
3. After creation, run these commands in this folder:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/universal-understanding-v4.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Option B — use `gh` CLI to create + push (recommended if you have `gh` installed):

```powershell
gh repo create <your-username>/universal-understanding-v4 --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

After pushing:
- Open GitHub → Settings → Pages and ensure source is `main` branch and folder is `/` (root). The Pages build will run automatically.
- If Pages build fails, open Actions → workflow run for "pages build and deployment" and inspect logs.

If you want, paste the new repo URL here and I can check the Pages build status for you.
